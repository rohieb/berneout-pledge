The Berneout Pledge 1e

Contributors to projects published under free-of-charge public
licenses, or "free public projects", share specific expectations
about licensing.  I make this pledge to show that I understand those
expectations, share them, and follow them myself.

Unless I specifically say otherwise, whenever I offer a contribution to
a free public project, I license my contribution under the same license
terms on which that project is licensed to the public at the time.

I am aware of legal rules, like "work made for hire" rules, that can
give employers and clients ownership of intellectual property in work
that I do.  I am also aware that legal agreements I make can transfer
ownership of intellectual property in my work to others.

I pledge not to offer contributions to free public projects that
I know may contain others' intellectual property without their
written, legally binding permission.  When I offer a contribution with
permission, I pledge to mention in the contribution who may own what
intellectual property, and how they gave permission to contribute it.

This pledge applies to all the contributions I offer, so long as I
make this pledge available at:
